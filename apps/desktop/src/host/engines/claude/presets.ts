/**
 * Frozen Claude permission-preset table (cut §1.4). A pure, side-effect-free
 * data module with zero contact with core's permission engine
 * (`supportsCorePermissions` stays false for Claude; ModeMenu stays hidden).
 *
 * Each preset maps to ONE `--permission-mode` value. The wire/flag asymmetry is
 * real and load-bearing: the mode the control protocol and `system/init` call
 * `default` is the mode the CLI flag calls `manual` (probe #8) — the mapping
 * lives in protocol.ts and is applied at both the spawn boundary and the
 * mid-session `set_permission_mode` boundary.
 *
 * Three CLI modes are deliberately NOT exposed, and this is now measured
 * behaviour rather than caution (probe #8):
 *   - `dontAsk`         auto-DENIES with no control event at all — the bridge
 *                       would have nothing to show the user.
 *   - `auto`            a classifier approves SILENTLY, bypassing the control
 *                       channel — zero approval visibility.
 *   - `bypassPermissions` unreachable mid-session without a spawn flag.
 * (The codex analogue of this exclusion is its `never` approval policy.)
